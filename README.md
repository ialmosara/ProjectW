# ProjectW

## Introduction

This is ProjectW (name TBD) - a product geared towards spreading awareness of mental health issues.

Our project will be broken up into 3 different sections: 
1. Art page where we take the stories from volunteers, have artists portray them on a canvas.
2. Course curriculum formulated by mental health enthusiasts and professionals to guide users with dealing with issues on their own.
3. General mental health resource to redirect users towards therapist in their local area.
